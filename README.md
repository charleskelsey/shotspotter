ShotSpotter aims to develop an intelligent system capable of automatically recognizing and
updating the score of an NBA or any basketball game by analyzing recorded video footage using
advanced computer vision techniques. The system will differentiate between various scoring
types such as three-pointers, two-pointers, and free throws by processing game footage. The
primary goal is to accurately determine the location of the shot, classify the shot type, and update
the game score accordingly.
